This is a simple web app powered by machine learning to predict the type of flower from the most popular iris dataset.
We have used Logistic Regression to train our model and we have created our web app using Flask Framework.


# Objective
The main objective this project is not to show the machine learning but rather to show how we can integrate any machine learning model with flask framework  and deploy it on the cloud so that it is accessible to every one.
When you provide all features of flower it predicts the type of flower according to the features provided.


### Installation


```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
If you need to deploy it on the cloud then just fork this and then go to heroku.com and create an account
- New
- Create a new app
- Name your app
- Link your GitHub repo
- Then click on install
